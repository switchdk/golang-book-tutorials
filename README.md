# golang-book tutorial answers

My personal attempt at answering the questions in the tutorials for [An Introduction to Programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro).

I restricted myself to not be allowed to use internet searches to solve code problems so all answers are based on the content provided in the `An Introduction to Programming in Go`
